%  min   (x1 - 5)^2 + (2 x2 + 1)^2
%  s.t.  -1.5 x1 + 2 x2 + x3 - 0.5 x4 + x5 = 2
%        x3 complements (3 x1 - x2 - 3)
%        x4 complements (-x1 + 0.5 x2 + 4)

%  The complementarity constraints must be converted so that one nonnegative
%  variable complements another nonnegative variable.

%  The solution is (1, 0, 3.5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6), with objective value 17.
